Building a toy dump truck that can follow lines drawn in chalk.

## About

🚂 Toy trains are fun, but your ideas are limited by how much track you have.

🖍️ What if you could draw the tracks with chalk? 

Introducing Chalk Tracks!

🚚 This project aims to build a toy dump truck that follows tracks drawn in chalk. It will drive where you draw!

We're building this in order to:
* Explore a product idea
* Develop an ML-based portfolio project
* Keep the kids entertained!

The envisaged system consists of a motorised toy dump truck with a forward-facing camera fitted, running a segmentation model for chalk line detection. The bulk of the work will involve building the platform, and developing the chalk line segmentation model.
